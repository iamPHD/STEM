    <h1>Chicken</h1>

    <p> <b>chicken (Gallus domesticus)</b> is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from
        Southeast Asia.
        They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl <sub>(the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
            junglefowl, and green junglefowl)</sub>.[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger
        male may be
        called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.
        An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
    </p>

    <p>
        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.
        There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and
        literature.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <p>
        Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[20]
        In fact, chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources,
        and still often in trade and scientific contexts,
        chicken as a species are typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21]

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <h3>Behaviour</h3>
    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>

    <p>
        According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e., a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th
        century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is widely
        used throughout North America.<br>
        Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.<sup><a href="http://sdfsdfdsf.com">[25]</a></sup>
